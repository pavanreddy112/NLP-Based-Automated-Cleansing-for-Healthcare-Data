## Project Overview

In the healthcare industry, data is often unstructured, inconsistent, and prone to errors due to various sources and manual entry processes. This project aims to address these challenges by implementing an NLP-based solution that automates the data cleansing process. By leveraging machine learning models and linguistic algorithms, the system identifies and corrects inaccuracies, standardizes formats, and enriches the data for better usability.

## Data Description

The dataset utilized in this project comprises synthetic patient records, including:

- **Patient Information**: Name, Age, Gender, Blood Type
- **Admission Details**: Date of Admission, Doctor's Name, Hospital Name, Room Number, Admission Type
- **Medical Information**: Medications Prescribed, Test Results
- **Financial Information**: Insurance Provider, Billing Amount
- **Discharge Details**: Discharge Date

*Note*: The dataset is generated for the purpose of this project and does not contain real patient information.

## Features

- **Data Standardization**: Ensures uniformity in data representation (e.g., date formats, categorical values).
- **Error Detection and Correction**: Identifies and rectifies typographical errors and inconsistencies.
- **Data Enrichment**: Augments existing data with additional relevant information.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interactive web application for seamless user experience.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pavanreddy112/NLP-Based-Automated-Cleansing-for-Healthcare-Data.git
   cd NLP-Based-Automated-Cleansing-for-Healthcare-Data
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
   - Add your IBM Cloud API credentials:
     ```
     API_KEY=your_ibm_cloud_api_key
     DEPLOYMENT_URL=your_ibm_cloud_deployment_url
     ```

## Usage

To run the application:

1. **Start the Streamlit Application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Access the Web Interface**:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

3. **Interact with the Application**:
   - Input the required healthcare data into the form.
   - Submit the form to receive cleansed data and predictions.
